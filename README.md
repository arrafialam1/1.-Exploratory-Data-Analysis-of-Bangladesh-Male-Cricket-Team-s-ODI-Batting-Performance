## üõ†Ô∏è Data Cleaning and Preparation

1. **Handling Missing Values**:
   - Replaced `NaN` (Not a Number) values with 0 using `numpy.nan_to_num()` for smooth analysis.
2. **Data Type Conversion**:
   - Used `pandas.to_numeric()` to convert object columns to numeric types, avoiding `ValueError: Could Not Convert String to Float`.
3. **Conditional Filtering**:
   - Selected rows based on specific conditions (e.g., innings batted, specific opposition teams).
4. **Data Aggregation**:
   - Utilized `groupby()` and `.sum()` methods to compute totals for performance metrics.
